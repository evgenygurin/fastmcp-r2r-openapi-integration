## Introduction

**R2R** (Retrieval to Riches) is an engine for building user-facing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applications. It provides core services through an architecture of providers, services, and an integrated RESTful API. This documentation offers a detailed walkthrough of interacting with R2R, including installation, configuration, and leveraging its advanced features such as data ingestion, search, RAG, and knowledge graphs.

For a deeper dive into the R2R system architecture, refer to the [R2R System Architecture](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/introduction/system).
